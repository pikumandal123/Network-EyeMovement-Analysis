# NetworkModelling-EyeMovement-Analysis
This project contains codes I wrote in R to visualize and analyze eye movement data obtained from dynamic object tracking tasks.
The code reads scanpath sequence data and then develops a directed weighted network model to visualize the overall visual scanning strategy of an observer. In addition, the code also calculates various network centrality measures to identify the important targets with respect to the visual scanning strategy of the observer.
